# Datapipe Process 

This is a process to show how I would develop a robust and automated datapipe process using Azure Data Factory to ingest and orchestrate data, Snowflake as my datawarehouse, DBT to transform the data, and Looker to visualize que results.

##

The main ideia of this project is to present a well documented datapipeline, following best pratices, ensuring governance over the process and good replicability as well.
